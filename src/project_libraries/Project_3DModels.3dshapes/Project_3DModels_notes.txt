The CUI_DEVICES-PJ-102A model was provided by CUI Devices.
It was recolored to better match the other components, but it is otherwise unchanged.

The following models were taken from the KiCad 3D Models library (Version 5.1.10):
D_DO-41_SOD81_P10.16mm_Horizontal
SW_PUSH_6mm
No changes were made to any of these models.

All other models were created from scratch.


The colors used to recolor the parts are as follows:
Black: #1f1f1f
Gold: #ffcf5f
Tin: #cccccc
White: #ffffff
Brown: #8b4417
